Playing around with computer chess in julia

"""
To do:
 - Provide take moves before move moves -> faster alphabeta cutoff?
 - With bitboards, can keep things immutable: generate a new board. Easily track castling etc.
 - bitboard is giving about 40,000,000 movesearch + move [+ takeback] per second
 - Never make a list of available moves. Just generate them and search straight away.
 - Pawn structure evaluator idea: just play pawns forward without pieces.
 - Generate dictionary of knight moves in advance.

Use bitwise operators e.g. << to shift pieces around...

===========================
 - apply! and takeback! update board piece points for potential speedup. Also update board hash,
 - Hash function idea: each piece/square combination is assigned a random hash at the start. For each board configuration, all true contingencies gives you a set of hashes. Bitwise or these together. Can then update this function on the fly, much like board points.
 - Pawn structure, castling, ratio of points and king/rook unmoved board points
 - Blocking pieces and no need to check square is in range
 - En passent + Three-in-a-row rule...
 - Serialize board -> hash table - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
 - Get parallel threads running + computer thinking while human is thinking.
 - Null moves + quiescence search
 - Neural net static evaluator
